# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will introduce the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm in R. Although, `R` can be seen more as a [Functional Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming), different OOP systems can be used. In particular, we will cover `S3` and `R6` (as we will define below). The main reference here is the [`Advanced R` book](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html).
