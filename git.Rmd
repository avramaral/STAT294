# Introduction

**Git** is a *distributed version control system* software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. On the other hand, **GitHub** is a cloud platform for software development and *version control* using Git (adapted from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub)).

## Installation

To download and install Git, refer to [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (or [https://github.com/git-guides/install-git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)). And to verify if Git was successfully installed, type `git --version` on the terminal.

To create a GitHub account, go to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/), click on `Sign Up`, and follow the instructions.

# General Procedure

After navigating to the desired folder on the terminal using the `cd` command, and creating a local repository using the `git init` command, the general can be expressed through the following image (the below diagram was inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fUbBnN_H2c))

<div class = 'space'></div>

Meaning that we can use the `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, and `git clone` commands to move files along compartments. Also, notice that the changes are tracked and saved in the **Commit history**.

# First steps

After installing Git, it is important to set an username and your email address (the same as from your GitHub account). To do this, on the terminal
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git config --global user.name 'username'
git config --global user.email 'email@email.com'
```
Replacing `'username'` and `'email@email.com'` by the appropriate values.

And to check the values, one can use the following commands
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git config user.name
git config user.email
```

Although the next step is not mandatory, it is a good practice to change the name of the main branch from `master` to `main`, (for consistency with GitHub guidelines). We can do this using the following command
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

## Creating your first repository

Let's create our first repository. To do this, on the terminal (if on Windows, the `cmd`), navigate to your `Desktop` directory, and create a new folder named `STAT294`. Depending on your directories structure, you can do this in the following way
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
cd ~/Desktop/
mkdir STAT294
cd STAT294
```

Finally, to create/initialize a repository, use the `git init` command. That is,
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git init
```

To make sure that a repository was created, you can look for the `.git` folder by typing the `ls -a` command. On the other hand, if you want to delete the `.git` folder (and therefore, the repository settings), you can type `rm -rf .git`.

## Moving files to the Staging area

Now, let’s create some non-significant files on `/STAT294/`, so that we can see how to work with them. You can do this by typing `touch file1.R file2.R` (or you can create them manually). For this situation, we would have the following files structure

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
Desktop/
└── STAT294/
    ├── .git/
    ├── file1.R
    └── file2.R
```

To see these files' status, you can use the `git status` command.

Also, you can send a file (e.g., `file1.R`) to the **Staging area** with the `git add file1.R` command (to send all files at once, use `git add .`).

After doing this, run `git status` again.

You can remove a file (e.g., `file1.R`) from the **Staging area** with the `git rm --cached file1.R` command. After doing this, run the `git status` command one more time. 

Before going to the next subsection send all files to the **Staging area** with
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git add .
```

## Creating commits

A **commit** can be seen as a *safe point*. Meaning that you can always refer back to them, if needed. To create a commit (based on the **Staging area**), use the following command
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git commit -m 'meaningful but short message'
```

For example, you can start your list of commits with the following command
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git commit -m 'initial commit'
```

You can check the status of your repository using the `git status` command. Also, to see the log of commits, use the `git log` command.

Now, modify `file1.R` and do all steps again. In particular, use the following commands
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
nano file1.R (to modify the file1.R)
git status
git add .
git status
git commit -m 'modify file 1'
git status
git log
```

To go back in time and revert your project to one of your safe points (i.e., to one of your previous commits), you can use the following commands
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git log (and copy the commit key; e.g., 42037c4bf5c1fe189a62632b393f6971979d8bf4)
git revert --no-commit 42037c4bf5c1fe189a62632b393f6971979d8bf4..HEAD
git commit -m 'back to old version X'
```

Notice that there are different ways to do this (getting back to a point in the past), but **never** delete your history of commits. After all, that is the main reason why you should use Git: **for tracking your changes**.

If you want to visit older commits, use the `git checkout (commit key)` command. To come back, use the `git switch -` command.
